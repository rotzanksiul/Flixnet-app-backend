This is a full-stack movie app featuring a collection of fictional films. It is built with multiple technologies like React, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. I've used Canva to make the rows and logo designs. I took my time to make all the movies content based on my favorite Games, animes, manga, and TV shows.

This is the Back-end repository.
